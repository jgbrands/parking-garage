/**
 * Agent is the most granular object that is simulated. An agent in the
 * simulator is most easily represented as a person. For the sake of the
 * simulation engine however, this is irrelevant. Thus the agent can be thought
 * of as a more abstract thing.
 *
 * Agents have agency, in this sense represented as their behaviour. Their
 * behaviour decides for example how likely they are to have a parking pass
 * and for how long they will park their car, and when they are most likely to
 * spawn (arrive) at the garage. But also where they park their car, and how.
 *
 * Agents are the lifeblood of the simulator. Almost all logic depends on them
 * in some way, they are what makes everything move and seem 'alive.'
